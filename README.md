# ScoreKit

Swift library unifying LilyPond engraving (publication-quality) with real‑time Swift rendering and AudioTalk semantics.

Highlights
- LilyPond wrapper for canonical engraving (PDF/SVG) — not bundled on iOS
- Swift native renderer (SwiftUI/CoreGraphics) for interactive editing
- Semantic tags (`AudioTalk.*`) to bridge notation ↔ performance
- Designed for integration with Fountain‑Coach (AudioTalk, Fountain‑Store, Teatro)

Getting Started
- SwiftPM: add this repo as a dependency, use `ScoreKit` and `ScoreKitUI` targets
- macOS/iOS: `ScoreView` (placeholder) composes a basic SwiftUI view
- LilyPond pipeline will be enabled on macOS/Linux in upcoming milestones

Roadmap
- See `AGENTS.md` for architecture, milestones (M0–M8), and conventions
